# Benchmarks for Polynomial Chaos expansions in Python

This repo contains a comparison of different packages for Polynomial Chaos expansions in Python. We benchmark each package against the Sobol function, a well-known test problem in sensitivity analysis and uncertainty quantification.

We compare these packages:
- [chaospy](https://github.com/jonathf/chaospy)
- [pygpc](https://github.com/pygpc-polynomial-chaos/pygpc)
- [scikit-learn](https://github.com/PieterjanRobbe/scikit-learn) (fork from [scikit-learn](https://github.com/scikit-learn/scikit-learn))

See notebook `comparison.ipynb` for the results.
